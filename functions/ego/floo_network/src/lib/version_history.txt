0.1.0
    Actually made the version.txt file, so this is pretty much the start of the library lol

0.2.0
    Random changes to coords to make things work better idk

0.2.1
    Changed a bunch of events to use the new coordinate/vector system

        fixed a glitch with selector() not doing math properly
        doing math on coords -> doing math on coords.vec

    Changed virus.ccu to use the function shortcut
    Fixed the fact that players don't teleport where they should be teleported
