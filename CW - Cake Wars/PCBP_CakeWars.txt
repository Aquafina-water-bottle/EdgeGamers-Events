FUNC Func_RandomComments


	-CTF + Survival games -- Destroy enemy's cake
		-Cake = allows respawns
	-Currency = food related
	
	-Dark's map
		-Hardest / smallest
		-Bread, pumpkin pie, cake, wheat = currency
		-No generators - mid = villagers + chickens
	
	-Island = cake on pillar
	-Can cover with resources
	-Starts with 1 wheat seed, 1 pumpkin seed, stone hoe, cow, villager for basics
	
	-Questions:
	1. Number of players per team
	2. Team colors and names
	3. Destroy enemy cake = break block or eat
	4. Timer until no respawns - Do we need one & if we do, when will it happen?
	5. Why not give them an unbreakable hoe at the beginning?
	
	

	With Bed Wars being a super hit, I thought it would be fun to make something like it for our server. For right now I'm building it under my mall near spawn. Coop has been very helpful in getting me the materials and building. 
	The task will be protecting your cake and eating the other team's cake, seems easy but one thing I'd add to make the game a bit longer is there will be 3 pillars which you can place other cakes.
	Each team will have a 30 by 30 area with a 9 by 9 crop field, one cow, one wheat seed, one pumpkin seed, one melon seed, two chickens, a shovel, and a cake on the middle pillar.
	I have no idea about prizes, apparently I have the cheapest mending book villagers(3) <-only idea I have atm. 
	I'm looking up economy plugins for this so there is a way people get items for this game (Bones, Iron, Diamonds, Building Blocks, Items to make potions). If anyone has other ideas please share!
	
	Cake wars is kinda like capture the flag mixed with survival games. You destroy the enemies cake so they can't respawn and just try to kill everyone.
	Depending on the map difficulty there may be more/less items uses for currency. But one thing is for sure all currency will be food related.
	Dark's Map: Will be the hardest map and smallest map. Having only bread, pumpkin pie, cake, and wheat seeds to buy things. There is no "diamond gen" on this map, only a mid that has 6 villagers and 4 chickens. There are signs on all graves, 4 of each sign except for the middle one (11 graves on both sides)
	teams start on their own island with a cake on a pillar, they can cover it with resources. the team starts with 1 wheat seed, 1 pumpkin seed, stone hoe, a cow. they also have a villager to trade with for basic items such as building blocks and other ingredients
	
	
	Cake Wars!
	Keep your cake safe from enemy teams! 
	Strats:
	--Rushing mid
	--Camping at the base
	--Camping at the base and getting bows
	--Using bows to make sure one team canâ€™t get any resources the whole game
	--Skybasing
	--Building massive walls around your base...
